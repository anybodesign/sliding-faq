Create a nice and accessible accordion FAQ section with sliding Q/A.


== Description ==

AD Sliding FAQ creates a custom post type in order to create your FAQ. Once your FAQ posts are created you can add the FAQ in a page or a post with a shortcode, or in a template with a function. This plugin has been created with accessibility in mind.

= How To =

To display your FAQ use the shortcode [sliding_faq] in a page or a post. By default, the output HTML for the questions is H2.
If you want to have H3, just add the attribute *heading* to the shortcode, for example: [sliding_faq heading="h3"] 

= Translations = 

You can translate AD Sligin FAQ on [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org). 


== Installation ==

* Download the zip archive and upload it to your WordPress site. 
* Activate the plugin, then you will notice a new FAQ section in your dashboard. 
* Start creating your FAQ!


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I display my FAQ? =
