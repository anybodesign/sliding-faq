Create a nice and accessible accordion FAQ section with sliding Q/A.


== Description ==

AD Sliding FAQ creates a custom post type in order to create your FAQ. Once your FAQ posts are created you can add the FAQ in a page or a post with a shortcode, or in a template with a function. This plugin has been created with accessibility in mind.


= How-To =

To display your FAQ use the shortcode [sliding_faq] in a page or a post. By default, the questions are wrapped inside a *H2* HTML tag.
If you want to have *H3* instead, just add the attribute *heading* to the shortcode, for example: `[sliding_faq heading='h3']`.
You can create different topics for your FAQ using the custom taxonomy *FAQ Topics*, this way you can display multiple FAQ. To do so, add the *topic* attribute to the shortcode with the name of your topic(s), for example: `[sliding_faq topic='Accessibility, SEO']`.
You can of course use both attributes: `[sliding_faq heading='h3' topic='Accessibility']`.
Featured images are now supported and the default size is 'thumbnail'. You can choose other dimensions size with the 'size' attribute: `[sliding_faq size='large']`. The attribute will support *thumbnail, medium, large* and *full* or any custom size. (Note that you'll have to customize the CSS if you want to display a large image.)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I display my FAQ? =

To display your FAQ, just add the shortcode `[sliding_faq]` in a post or a page! Use the *heading* attribute to select the heading level, for example: `[sliding_faq heading='h3']`. Use the *topic* attribute to display multiple FAQ, for example: `[sliding_faq topic='Accessibility, SEO']`.

= Can I use a function directly in one of my theme templates to display my FAQ? =

Sure, you can use the function `<?php sliding_faq(); ?>` in your theme templates. As for the shortcode, you can choose the heading level you want instead of *h2* for the questions, for example: `<?php sliding_faq('h3'); ?>`, and you can choose a FAQ topic: `<?php sliding_faq('h3','Accessibility'); ?>`
